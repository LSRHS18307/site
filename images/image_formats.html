<h1> Image Formats!</h1>



  <h>JPEG </h>

  <p> The JPG was created by Joint Photographic Expert Group. This method uses the ZIP file method of compressing the immage. This is good for larger images because it is easier to store them, this is because it takes up less space. The problem with JPG files is that they are not editable once they are in the JPG form.</p>


    <h> GIF </h>

    <p> The GIF is similar to the JPG that it is an older file type. GIF stands for Graphics Interface Format. A GIF is a 8 bit color file. So there are only 256 avalible to choose from. GIFs also have the option of being animated with their 256 color options. GIF is not a good modern day photo storage method, even though it can be smaller than JPG most likley the JPEG can compress its self more. </p>

      <h>PNG</h>

      <p> A PNG file is the best file for storing images online because it supports transparency in web browsers. PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics. PNG supports 8 bit images but it also supports 24 bit color RGB. </p>
